This is the second prototype I've created around the idea of 31 keys per octave
for a keyboard instrument. This is not a new idea, but with touchscreen
technology I think it's worth exploring. The technologies this depends on
currently are qt5, csound, libmtdev, and Ubuntu 13.

Work in progress, in many ways. Right now this code will probably only work
on my hardware. It's specifically designed for 15" 1920x1080 multitouch screens.
